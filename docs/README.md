# Documentation

This folder tracks architecture decisions, parity contracts, and execution plans.

## Structure
- `references/`: external reference snapshots used as input sources.
- `adr/`: architecture decision records for parity scope and trade-offs.
- `plans/`: execution plans, gap register, matrix, and acceptance checklist.

## Reading Order
1. `adr/0001-current-implementation-baseline.md`
2. `adr/0002-backend-and-parity-scope.md`
3. `plans/parity-matrix.md`
4. `plans/runtime-gap-register.md`

## Rules
- Keep docs plain layman's English.
- Keep docs short and exact.
- Every high-risk runtime behavior needs an ADR reference.
